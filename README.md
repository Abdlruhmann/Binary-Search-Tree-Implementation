# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in C. The program supports the following operations:

1. **Insert a Node**: Adds a node with a specified value into the binary search tree.
2. **In-order Traversal**: Traverses the tree in in-order (left, root, right) and prints the node values.
3. **Pre-order Traversal**: Traverses the tree in pre-order (root, left, right) and prints the node values.
4. **Post-order Traversal**: Traverses the tree in post-order (left, right, root) and prints the node values.

## Features:
- Interactive menu-based program to manage a BST.
- Supports multiple insertions of nodes in the tree.
- Displays tree elements using three types of tree traversal techniques (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## Getting Started:

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abdlruhmann/Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation.git
   gcc -o main.c
   ./bst_program
